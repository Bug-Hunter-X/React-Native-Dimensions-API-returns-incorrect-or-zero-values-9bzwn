This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications where the `Dimensions` API returns inaccurate screen dimensions, often resulting in zero values.  The issue is resolved by utilizing the `useEffect` hook and making sure the dimensions are fetched after the layout has been completed. The example demonstrates the incorrect and corrected implementations using state to manage the dimensions.  The solution leverages the `Dimensions` API effectively.
